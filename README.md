emotion.ly
==========

Emotion.ly is a mental health application that was built under the influence of Dr. Joseph P. Mathew (M.D., New York) when discovering patients having difficulties over speech patterns. This app is certainly not limited to hospital patients only. It provides a daily sense of comfort, as well as a state of well-being. Try it out while it's free (for now)!

We are currently in the process of building a super-ific app, so stay tuned for updates soon. As well as, this app is open sourced on github.
